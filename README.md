# `APM_Figures`

The repository contains figures for the book [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/). 

Potato quality of bitmaps is attributable to [`convert`](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) so suggestions for conversion are welcome.

Note that the copyright to these figures is held by Springer. 

Two or three images in the book are not in this repository because they are owned by someone else (e.g. XKCD)
